# African Marketplace

## Live App: https://african-marketplace-2022.vercel.app/

### ☝️ Pitch

Sauti Africa empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty.

You will build a platform to enable these business owners to create listing for items they have for sale.

### ✅ MVP

1. A small business `owner` can login and see relevant prices in various categories to help them set their own prices.

2. They can also make listing for `items` they want to sell, which will show up to all `users`.

3. They add a new `item` by selecting their market `location` and typing in their item's `name`, `description`, and `price`.
